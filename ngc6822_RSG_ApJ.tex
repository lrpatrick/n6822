\begin{abstract}
We present near-IR spectroscopy of red supergiant (RSG) stars in NGC\,6822, obtained with the new VLT-KMOS instrument.
From comparisons with model spectra in the $J$-band we determine the metallicity of 11 RSGs, finding a mean value of [Z] $= -0.52 \pm 0.21$ which agrees well with previous abundance studies of young stars and HII regions.
We also find an indication for an abundance gradient within the central 1\,kpc, although with low significance because
of the small number of objects studied.
We compare our results to those derived from older stellar populations and investigate the difference using chemical evolution models.
By comparing the physical properties determined for RSGs in NGC\,6822 with those derived using the same technique in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, we show that there appears to be no significant temperature variation of RSGs with respect to metallicity, in contrast to recent evolutionary models.

\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:introduction}
A promising new method to directly probe chemical abundances in external galaxies is with $J$-band spectroscopy of red supergiant (RSG) stars.
With their peak flux at
$\sim$1\,$\mu$m and luminosities in excess of
10$^4$\,L$_\odot$, RSGs are extremely bright in the near-IR
(with $-$8\,$\le$\,M$_{J}$\,$\le$\,$-$11).
Therefore, RSGs are useful tools with which to map the chemical evolution of their host galaxies, out to large distances.
To realise this goal,
\cite{2010MNRAS.407.1203D} outlined a technique to derive metallicities of RSGs at moderate spectral resolving power
($R\sim$3000).
This technique has recently been refined using observations of RSGs in the Magellanic Clouds
\citep{Davies-prep} and Perseus OB-1
\citep{2014ApJ...788...58G}.
Using absorption lines in the $J$-band from iron, silicon and titanium, one can estimate metallicity
([Z] = log (Z/Z$_{\odot}$)) as well as other stellar parameters
(effective temperature, surface gravity and microturbulence) by fitting synthetic spectra to the observations.
Owing to their intrinsic brightness,
RSGs are ideal candidates for studies of extragalactic environments in the near-IR.

To make full use of the potential of RSGs for this science, multi-object spectrographs operating in the near-IR on 8-m class telescopes are essential.
These instruments allow us to observe a large sample of RSGs in a given galaxy, at a wavelength where RSGs are brightest.
In this context, the K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph
\citep[KMOS;][]{2013Msngr.151...21S} at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chile, is a powerful facility.
KMOS will enable determination of stellar abundances and radial velocities for RSGs out to distances of 10\,Mpc.
Further ahead, a near-IR multi-object spectrograph on a 40-m class telescope, combined with the excellent image quality from adaptive optics,
will enable abundance estimates for individual stars in galaxies out to tens of Mpc,
a significant volume of the local universe containing entire galaxy clusters
\citep{2011A&A...527A..50E}.

Here we present KMOS observations of RSGs in the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC\,6822,
at a distance of $\sim$0.46\,Mpc
\citep[][and references therein]{2012AJ....144....4M}.
Its present-day iron abundance is thought to be intermediate to that of the LMC and SMC
\citep{2013ApJ...779..102K},
% 1999A&A...352L..40M,2006ApJ...647..970L},
but we lack firmer constraints on both its metallicity and its recent chemical evolution.
Observations of two A-type supergiants by
\cite{2001ApJ...547..765V} provided a first estimate of stellar abundances, finding
log (Fe/H) $+12=7.01\pm0.22$ and
log(O/H)   $+12=8.36\pm0.19$, based on line-formation calculations for these elements,
assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).
A detailed non-LTE study for one of these objects confirmed the results finding
$6.96\pm 0.09$ for iron and $8.30\pm0.02$ for oxygen
\citep{Przybilla02}.
Compared to solar values of 7.50 and 8.69, respectively
\citep{2009ARA&A..47..481A}, 
this indicates abundances that are about 0.5 dex lower in NGC\,6822.
A study of oxygen abundances in HII regions
\citep{2006ApJ...642..813L} found a value of $8.11\pm0.1$, confirming the low metallicity.


NGC\, 6822 is a relatively isolated Local Group galaxy, which does not seem to be associated with either M31 or the Milky Way.
It appears to have a relatively large extended stellar halo
\citep{2002AJ....123..832L,2014ApJ...783...49H} 
as well as an extended HI disk containing tidal arms and a possible HI companion
\citep{2000ApJ...537L..95D}.
The HI disk is orientated perpendicular to the distribution of old halo stars and has an associated population of blue stars 
\citep{2003MNRAS.341L..39D,2003ApJ...590L..17K}.
This led \cite{2006ApJ...636L..85D} to label the system as a
~\textquoteleft
polar ring galaxy\textquoteright.
A population of remote star clusters aligned with the elongated old stellar halo have been recently discovered
\citep{2011ApJ...738...58H,2013MNRAS.429.1039H}.
The extended structures of NGC\,6822 suggest some form of recent interaction.

In addition, there is evidence for a relatively constant star-formation history within the central 5\,kpc
\citep{2014ApJ...789..147W}
with multiple stellar populations
\citep{2006A&A...451...99B,2012A&A...540A.135S}.
This includes evidence for recent star formation in the form of a known population of massive stars, as well as a number of HII regions
\citep{2001ApJ...547..765V,2006AJ....131..343D,2009A&A...505.1027H,2012AJ....144....2L}.

In this paper we present near-IR spectroscopy of RSGs in NGC\,6822 from KMOS.
In Section~\ref{sec:observations} we describe the observations.
Section~\ref{sec:data_reduction} describes the data reduction and 
% radial velocities are estimated for our targets in Section~\ref{sec:membership}.
Section~\ref{sec:results} details the derived stellar parameters and investigates the presence of an abundance gradient in NGC\,6822.
In Section~\ref{sec:discussion} we discuss our results and
Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} concludes the paper.

\subsection{Target Selection} % (fold)
\label{sub:target_selection}

Our targets were selected from optical photometry
\citep{2007AJ....134.2474M}, combined with near-IR ($JHK{_s}$) photometry
\cite[for details see][]{2012A&A...540A.135S} from the Wide-Field Camera (WFCAM) on the United Kingdom Infra-Red Telescope (UKIRT).
The two catalogues were cross-matched and only sources classified as stellar in the photometry for all filters were considered.

Our spectroscopic targets were selected principally based on their optical colours, as defined by
\cite{1998ApJ...501..153M} and
\cite{2012AJ....144....2L}.
Figure~\ref{fig:BVR} shows cross-matched stars, with the dividing line at $(B - V) = 1.25 \times (V - R)+0.45$.
All stars redder than this line, with $V - R > 0.6$, are potential RSGs.

To increase confidence in the nature of our targets, those selected using the optical criterion are subjected to an additional criteria based on near-IR photometry,
using the known location of RSGs in the $J-K$ colour-magnitude diagram
\citep{2000ApJ...542..804N}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:JK}.

The combined selection methods yielded 58 potential targets, from which 18 stars were observed with KMOS, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:N6822}.
The selection of the final targets was defined by the KMOS arm allocation software {\sc karma}
\citep{2008SPIE.7019E..0TW},
where the field centre was defined to maximise the number of allocated arms,
with priority given to the brightest targets.
Of the 18 candidates, eight were previously spectroscopically confirmed as RSGs by
\cite{2012AJ....144....2L}.

\subsection{KMOS Observations} % (fold)
\label{sub:observations}

The observations were obtained as part of the KMOS Science Verification (SV) program on 30 June 2013 (PI: Evans 60.A-9452(A)),
with a total exposure time of 2400\,s
(comprising 8\,$\times$\,300\,s detector integrations).
% Observations for this study are from the new KMOS instrument on the VLT, Chile.
KMOS has 24 deployable integral-field units (IFUs) each of which covers an area of
2\farcs8 $\times$ 2\farcs8 within a 7\farcm2 field-of-view.
The 24 IFUs are split into three groups of eight, with the light from each group relayed to different spectrographs.

Offset sky frames
(0\farcm5 to the east) were interleaved between the science observations in an object (O), sky (S) sequence of:
O,\,S,\,O,\,O.
The observations were performed with the $YJ$ grating
(giving coverage from 1.0 to 1.359$\mu$m);
estimates of the delivered resolving power for each spectrograph (obtained from the KMOS/esorex pipeline for two arc lines) are listed in Table~\ref{tb:res}.

In addition to the science observations, a standard set of KMOS calibration frames were obtained consisting of dark, flat and arc-lamp calibrations (with flats and arcs taken at six different rotator angles).
A telluric standard star was observed with the arms configured in the science positions, i.e. using the {\em KMOS\_spec\_cal\_stdstarscipatt} template in which the standard star is observed sequentially through all the IFUs.
The observed standard was HIP97618, with a spectral type of B6\,III
\citep{1988mcts.book.....H}.

A summary of the observed targets is given in
Table~\ref{tb:obs-params}.
To perform the analysis to a satisfactory standard,
the signal-to-noise (S/N) per resolution element for any given spectrum must be $\gtrsim$ 100
\citep{2014ApJ...788...58G}.
We estimated the observed S/N by estimating the source signal in the in the
$1.15-1.22\mu$m region over the brightest spatial pixels.
The sky signal is estimated from the sky exposures in a region where no strong sky lines are present.
The S/N estimated is knowingly an underestimate of the true S/N achieved.

\section{Data Reduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:data_reduction}

The observations were reduced using the recipes provided by the Software Package for Astronomical Reduction with KMOS
\citep[SPARK;][]{2013A&A...558A..56D}.
The standard KMOS/esorex routines were used to calibrate and reconstruct the science and standard-star data cubes as outlined by
\cite{2013A&A...558A..56D}.
% On-sky flatfield exposures taken on the previous night were used to implement a more precise flatfield correction.
Sky subtraction was performed using the standard KMOS recipes and telluric correction performed using two different strategies.
% and an additional second-order sky subtraction technique is implemented~\citep{2007MNRAS.375.1099D}.
Throughout the analysis presented in this section all the spectra have been extracted from their respective data cubes using a consistent method (i.e. the optimal extraction method within the pipeline).


\subsection{Three-arm vs 24-arm Telluric Correction} % (fold)
\label{sub:three_arm_vs_24_arm_telluric_correction}

The standard template for telluric observations with KMOS is to observe a standard star in one IFU in each of the three spectrographs.
However, there is an alternative template which allows users to observe a standard star in each of the 24 IFUs.
This strategy should provide an optimum telluric correction for the KMOS IFUs but reduces observing efficiency.

A comparison between the two methods in the $H$-band was given by
\cite{2013A&A...558A..56D},
who concluded that using the more efficient three-arm method was suitable for most science purposes.
However, an equivalent analysis in the $YJ$-band was not available.
To determine if the more rigorous telluric routine is required for our analysis,
we observed a telluric standard star (HIP97618) in each of the 24 IFUs.
This gave us the data to investigate both telluric correction methods and to directly compare the two results.

We compared the standard star spectrum in each IFU with that used by the pipeline routines for the three-arm template in each of the spectrographs.
Figure~\ref{fig:IFU_compare} shows the differences between the standard star spectra across the IFUs,
where the differences in the $YJ$-band are comparable to those in the $H$-band
\cite[cf. Fig.7 from][]{2013A&A...558A..56D}.
The qualitative agreement between the IFUs in our region of interest (1.15 $-$ 1.22$\mu$m) is generally very good.


\begin{figure*}
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=12.0cm]{figures/N6822_t_compare}
 \caption{
    Comparison of $J$-band spectra of the same standard star in each IFU.
    The ratio of each spectrum compared to that from the IFU used in the three-arm telluric method is shown,
    with their respective mean and standard deviation ($\mu$ and $\sigma$).
    Red lines indicate $\mu$~=~1.0, $\sigma$~=~0.0 for each ratio.
    The blue shaded area signifies the region used in our analysis,
    within which, the discrepancies between the IFUs are generally small.
    This is reflected in the standard deviation values when only considering this region.
    (IFUs 13 and 16 are omitted as no data were taken with these IFUs.) \label{fig:IFU_compare}
          }
 \end{center}
\end{figure*}

To quantify the difference the two telluric methods would make to our analysis,
we performed the steps described in
Section~\ref{sub:ngc6822_telluric_correction} for both templates.
We then used the two sets of reduced science data
(reduced with both methods of the telluric correction) to compute stellar parameters for our targets.
The results of this comparison are detailed in Section
\ref{sub:telluric_comparison}.

% subsection three_arm_vs_24_arm_telluric_correction (end)

\subsection{Telluric Correction Implementation} % (fold)
\label{sub:ngc6822_telluric_correction}

To improve the accuracy of the telluric correction,
for both methods mentioned above,
we implemented additional recipes beyond those of the KMOS/esorex pipeline.
These recipes were employed to account for two effects which could potentially degrade the quality of the telluric correction.
The first corrects for any potential shift in wavelength between each science spectrum and its associated telluric standard.
The most effective way to implement this is to cross-correlate each pair of science and telluric standard.
% Performing a cross-correlation between two spectra with similar spectral features allows one to identify a shift in wavelength space as a maximum in the cross-correlation will be produced when the two spectra are exactly aligned.
Any shift between the two spectra is then applied to the telluric standard using a cubic-spline interpolation routine.

The second correction applied is a simple spectral scaling algorithm.
This routine corrects for differences in line intensity of the most prominent features common to both the telluric and science spectra.
To find the optimal scaling parameter the following formula is used,

\begin{equation} \label{eq:shiftandres}
T_{2} = (T_{1} + c) / (T_{1} - c),
\end{equation}

\noindent where $T_{2}$ is the corrected telluric standard spectrum,
$T_{1}$ is the initial telluric standard spectrum and $c$ is the scaling parameter.

To determine the required scaling,
telluric spectra are computed for $-0.5 < c < 0.5$, in increments of 0.02
(where a perfect value, i.e. no difference in line strength would be $c = 0$).
The standard deviation is then computed for each telluric-corrected science spectrum, and the minimum value of the standard-deviation matrix defines the optimum scaling.
For this algorithm, only the region of interest for our analysis is considered (i.e. $1.15 - 1.22\mu$m).

The final set of telluric standard spectra,
generated using the KMOS/esorex routines and modified using the additional routines described above,
are used to correct their respective science observations for the effects of the Earth's atmosphere.

\subsection{Sky Subtraction} % (fold)
\label{sub:sky_subtraction}

Initial inspection of the spectra revealed minor residuals from the sky subtraction process.
Reducing these cases with the \textquoteleft sky\_tweak\textquoteright
~option within the KMOS/esorex reduction pipeline was ineffective to improve the subtraction of these features.
Any residual sky subtraction features could potentially influence our results by perturbing the continuum placement within the model fits, which is an important aspect of the fitting process
\citep[see][for more discussion]{Davies-prep,2014ApJ...788...58G}.
Thus, pending a more rigorous treatment of the data
(e.g. to take into account the changing spectral resolution across the array),
we exclude objects showing residual sky-subtraction features from our analysis.
Of the 18 observed targets, 11 were used to derive stellar parameters
(as indicated in Table~\ref{tb:obs-params}).

% \section{NGC\,6822 Membership} % (fold)
% \label{sec:membership}
% Candidates were selected using their optical and near-IR colours,
% however, these criteria alone are not enough to conclusively determine whether these stars are genuine NGC\,6822 members.
% NGC\,6822 is at low galactic latitude (b$\sim$$-18^{\circ}$), which makes foreground contamination from Galactic stars with similar spectral types (i.e. M-dwarfs), particularly important.

% To assess membership of NGC\,6822 we estimated stellar radial velocities from the KMOS spectra for each target.
% Assigning membership to NGC\,6822 also confirms the luminosity class of our targets as supergiants.
% Relative radial velocities were estimated by cross-correlating the spectrum of each source,
% within the 1.15-1.22\,$\mu$m region,
% against a reference spectrum,
% chosen to be the highest S/N spectrum in our sample, RSG34.
% Figure
% \ref{fig:Vrad} shows the relative radial velocity for each target with respect to the reference target.
% Pending further characterisation of the absolute wavelength correction of the instrument for stellar work, we do not calculate absolute velocities here.
% RSG5 has a velocity which is just below three-sigma from the median
% and, as such, may not be associated with the same kinematic body as the other objects.

\section{Results} % (fold)
\label{sec:results}

Stellar parameters
(metallicity, effective temperature, surface gravity and microturbulence)
have been derived using the $J$-band analysis technique described by
\cite{2010MNRAS.407.1203D} and demonstrated by
\cite{Davies-prep} and
\cite{2014ApJ...788...58G}.
To determine physical parameters, this technique uses a grid of synthetic spectra to fit the observational data.
The resolution of the models is determined by the measured resolution from the KMOS/esorex pipeline (Table~\ref{tb:res}).
Model atmospheres were generated using the {\sc marcs} code
\citep{2008A&A...486..951G} where the range of parameters are defined in
Table~\ref{tb:mod_range}.
The precision of the models is increased by including departures from LTE in some of the strongest Fe, Ti and Si atomic lines
\citep{2012ApJ...751..156B,2013ApJ...764..115B}.
The two strong magnesium lines are excluded from the analysis at present as these lines are known to be affected strongly by non-LTE effects
(see Figure~\ref{fig:model_fits}, where the two MgI lines are systematically under- and over-estimated, respectively).
The non-LTE line-formation of Mg I lines will be explored by
\cite{Bergemann-prep}.

\subsection{Telluric Comparison} % (fold)
\label{sub:telluric_comparison}

We used these SV data to determine which of the two telluric standard methods is most appropriate for our analysis.
Table~\ref{tb:stellar-params} details the stellar parameters derived for each target using both telluric methods and these parameters are compared in 
Figure~\ref{fig:3vs24AT}.
The mean difference in metallicity for the two methods is
$\Delta [Z] = 0.01\pm 0.10$.
Therefore, for our analysis, there is no significant difference between the two telluric methods.

\subsection{Stellar Parameters and Metallicity} % (fold)
\label{sub:stellar_parameters_and_metallicity}

Table~\ref{tb:stellar-params} summarises the derived stellar parameters.
For the remainder of this paper, when discussing stellar parameters,
we adopt those derived using the 24-arm telluric method (i.e. the left-hand results in Table~\ref{tb:stellar-params}.)

The average metallicity for our sample of 11 RSGs in NGC\,6822 is
$\bar{Z} = -0.52\pm 0.21$.
This result is in good agreement with the average metallicity derived in
NGC\,6822 from blue supergiant stars
\citep[BSGs;][]{1999A&A...352L..40M,2001ApJ...547..765V}.
Excluding the potential outlier (RSG5) from this analysis does not affect the average metallicity measurement.

A direct comparison with metallicities from BSGs is legitimate as the results derived here yield a global metallicity ([Z]) which
closely resembles the Fe/H ratio derived from BSGs.
While our [Z] measurements are also affected by Si and Ti,
we assume [Z]~=~[Fe/H] for the purposes of our discussion.
Likewise, we can compare oxygen abundances (relative to solar) obtained from HII regions as a proxy for [Z] by
introducing the solar oxygen abundance
{12+log(O/H)}$_{\odot}$=8.69
\citep{2009ARA&A..47..481A} through the relation
[Z]=12+log(O/H)$-$8.69.

% Physically, the metallicities derived using RSGs, BSGs and HII regions are comparable as these objects represent similar stellar populations within this galaxy.
The RSG and BSG stages are different evolutionary stages within the life cycle of a massive star,
while HII regions are the birth clouds which give rise to the youngest stellar population.
As the lifetimes of RSGs and BSGs are $<50$Myr,
metallicity measurements from these stars are expected to be representative of the metallicities of their birth clouds.

To investigate the spatial distribution of chemical abundances in NGC\,6822,
in Figure~\ref{fig:ZvsR}
we show the metallicities of our RSGs as a function of radial distance from the centre of the galaxy,
as well as the results from
\cite{2001ApJ...547..765V} and indicative estimates from
\cite{1999A&A...352L..40M}.

A least-squares fit to the KMOS results reveals a low-significance abundance gradient within the central 1\,kpc of NGC\,6822 of $-0.52\pm0.35$ dex\,kpc$^{-1}$.
The extrapolated central metallicity from the fit (i.e. at R$=$0) of [Z]$=-0.30\pm0.15$ derived remains consistent with the average metallicity assuming no gradient.

\subsection{Metallicity Measurements} % (fold)
\label{sub:metallicity_measurements}

We find an average metallicity for NGC\,6822 of $\bar{Z}=-0.52\pm 0.21$
which agrees well with the results derived from BSGs
\citep{1999A&A...352L..40M,2001ApJ...547..765V,Przybilla02} and HII regions
\citep{2006ApJ...642..813L}.

We also find evidence for a low-significance metallicity gradient within the central 1\,kpc in NGC\,6822
($-0.52\pm0.35$ dex\,kpc$^{-1}$; see Figure~\ref{fig:ZvsR}).
The gradient derived is consistent with the trend reported in
\cite{2001ApJ...547..765V} who derived metallicities of two BSGs and combined that with some of the best available HII region data.
The gradient is also consistent with the metallicity gradient derived from a sample of 49 local star-forming galaxies
\cis{Ho-submitted}.
Including the results for BSGs from
\cite{2001ApJ...547..765V} 
in our analysis,
gives a consistent gradient
($-0.48\pm 0.33$ dex\,kpc$^{-1}$)
with a smaller 
$\chi^{2}_{red}=1.06$.

% A discussion on why we are able to directly compare these results using different objects and yielding different tracers of metallicity (i.e. [Z], [Fe/H] and [O/H]) is given in
% Section~\ref{sub:stellar_parameters_and_metallicity}.

\cite{2006ApJ...642..813L} used 19 HII
regions and found no clear evidence for a metallicity gradient.
Using a consistent subset of the highest quality HII
region data available these authors found a gradient of
$-0.16\pm0.05$dex\,kpc$^{-1}$.
Including these results into our analysis degrades the fit and changes the derived gradient significantly
($-0.18\pm0.05$ dex\,kpc$^{-1}$; $\chi^{2}_{red}=1.78$).
At this point it is not clear whether the indication of a gradient obtained from the RSGs and BSGs is an artefact of the small sample size, 
or indicates a difference with respect to the HII region study.

Comparing our results with previous estimates,
\cite{2001MNRAS.327..918T} use red giant branch (RGB) stars to estimate the mean metallicity of NGC\,6822 to be
[Fe/H] $=-0.9$ and found a large spread in meatllicity 
\citep[see Figure 19 in ][]{2001MNRAS.327..918T}.
\cite{2012A&A...540A.135S} derived metallicities using a population of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars within the central 4\,kpc of NGC\,6822.
They found an average metallicity of [Fe/H] $=-1.29\pm0.07$ dex.
Likewise
\cite{2013ApJ...779..102K}
used spectra of red giant stars within the central 2\,kpc and found an average metallicity of
[Fe/H] $=-1.05\pm0.49$.
These authors found no compelling evidence for spatial variations in metallicity.
The stellar populations used for these studies are known to be significantly older than the RSGs,
therefore, owing to the chemical evolution in the time between the birth of older populations, we expect the measured metallicities to be significantly lower.
Additionally, in disc galaxies, we expect a shallower metallicity gradient in these populations as radial migration acts to smooth out abundance gradients over time.
Therefore it is unsurprising that these authors see no evidence for abundance gradients.

The low metallicity of the young stellar population and the ISM in NGC 6822 can be easily understood as a consequence of the fact that it is a relatively gas rich galaxy with a mass
M$_{HI}$ = 1.38$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$
\citep{2004AJ....128...16K} and a total stellar mass of
M$_{*}$ = 1$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$
\citep{2014ApJ...789..147W}.
The simple closed-box chemical-evolution model relates the metallicity mass fraction Z(t) at any time to the ratio of stellar to gas mass $M_{*}\over M_{g}$ through

\begin{equation}\label{closed-box}
Z(t) = {y \over 1-R } \ln \left[ 1 + {M_{*}(t)\over M_{g}(t)}  \right],
\end{equation}

where $y$ is the fraction of metals per stellar mass produced through stellar nucleosynthesis
(the so-called yield) and $R$ is the fraction of stellar mass returned to the ISM through stellar mass-loss.
According to Kudritzki et al. (2014, in preparation) the ratio $y/(1-R)$ can be empirically determined from the fact that the metallicity of the young stellar population in the solar neighborhood is solar with a mass fraction Z$_{\odot}$ =0.014
\citep{2012A&A...539A.143N}.
% (Nieva \& Przybilla, 2012).
With a solar neighborhood ratio of stellar to gas mass column densities of 4.48
\citep{2003ApJ...587..278W,2013ApJ...779..115B}
one then obtains $y/(1-R)$ = 0.0082 = 0.59Z$_{\odot}$ with an uncertainty of 15 percent dominated by the 0.05 dex uncertainty of the metallicity determination of the young population in the solar neighbourhood.
Accounting for the presence of helium and metals in the neutral interstellar gas we can turn the observed HI mass in NGC 6822 into a gas mass via M$_{g}$ = 1.36 M$_{HI}$ and use the simple closed-box model to predict a metallicity of [Z] = $-0.6\pm0.05$,
in good agreement with our value obtained from RSG spectroscopy.

As discussed above, the older stellar population of AGB stars has a metallicity roughly 0.7 dex lower than what we measure for the RSGs. In the framework of the simple closed-box model this would correspond to a period in time where the ratio of stellar to gas mass was 0.07
(much lower than the present value of 0.53) and the stellar mass was only
$0.19\times10^{8}$M$_{\odot}$.
The present star-formation rate of NGC 6822 is 0.027 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$
\citep{1996A&A...308..723I,2006ApJ...652.1170C,2010A&A...512A..68G}.
% (Gratier et al., 2010, Cannon et al., 2006, Israel et al., 1996).
At such a high level of star formation it would have taken three Gyr to produce the presently observed stellar mass and to arrive from the average metallicity of the AGB stars to that of the young stellar population
(of course, again relying on the simple closed-box model).
With a lower star-formation rate it would have taken correspondingly longer.

Given the irregularities present in the morphology of NGC\,6822 this galaxy may not be a good example of a closed-box system, however it is remarkable that the closed-box model reproduces the observed metallicity so closely.

% \cite{2013ApJ...779..102K} use two variations of the closed box chemical evolution model and find the model which represents the data best to be the model including a gas accretion term, the so called accertion model.
% However, these authors do note that dwarf irregular galaxies in general can be explaind by the more simple leaky box model.

\subsection{Temperatures of RSGs} % (fold)
\label{sub:temperatures_of_rsgs}

Effective temperatures have been derived for 11 RSGs from our observed sample in NGC\,6822.
To date, this represents the fourth data set used to derive stellar parameters in this way and the first with KMOS.
The previous three data sets which have been analysed are those of 11 RSGs in PerOB1,
a Galactic star cluster
\citep{2014ApJ...788...58G}, nine RSGs in the LMC and 10 RSGs in the SMC
\citep[both from][]{Davies-prep}.
These results span a range of $\sim$0.7 dex in metallicity ranging from Z=Z$_{\odot}$ in PerOB1 to Z=0.3Z$_{\odot}$ in the SMC.

We compare the effective temperatures derived in this study to those of the previous results in different environments.
Their distribution is shown as a function of metallicity in Figure~\ref{fig:TvsZ}.
Additionally, Figure~\ref{fig:HRD} shows the H-R diagram for the for sets of results.
% As mentioned above, stellar parameters have been derived in a consistent way for this data set. 
Bolometric corrections for the entire sample are computed using the calibration in
\cite{2013ApJ...767....3D}.

        }
\end{figure}


From these figures, we see no evidence for significant variations in the average temperatures of RSGs with respect to metallicity.
This is in contrast to current evolutionary models which display a change of $\sim$450K,
for a $M=15M_{\odot}$ model,
over a range of 0.7 dex~\citep{2012A&A...537A.146E,2013A&A...558A.103G}.

For solar metallicity, observations in PerOB1 are in good agreement with the models
\citep[see Figure 9 in][]{2014ApJ...788...58G}.
However, at SMC-like metallicity, the end-points of the evolutionary models are systematically warmer than the observations.
The temperature of the end-points of the evolutionary models of massive stars could depend on the choice of the convective mixing length parameter
\citep{1992A&AS...96..269S}.
That the models produce a higher temperature than observed could imply that the choice of a solar-like mixing length parameter does not hold for higher mass stars at lower metallicity.

There is evidence however,
that the average spectral type of RSGs tends towards an earlier spectral type with decreasing metallicity over this range
\citep{1979ApJ...231..384H,2012AJ....144....2L}.
We argue that these conclusions are not mutually exclusive.
Spectral types are derived for RSGs using the optical TiO band-heads at
$\sim$0.65$\mu$m,
whereas in this study temperatures are derived using near-IR atomic features
(as well as the line-free pseudo-continuum).
The strength of TiO bands are dependent upon metallicity which means that 
the spectral classification for RSGs at a constant temperature will differ
\citep{2013ApJ...767....3D}. 
Therefore, although historically spectral type has been used as a proxy for temperature, this assumption does not provide an accurate picture for RSGs.

% Recently,
% \cite{2013ApJ...767....3D} showed that the strength of TiO bands are dependent upon metallicity and that at lower metallicity, the TiO bands are significantly weaker.
% The trend in spectral type (or strength of the TiO absorption features) can be naturally explained by the decreasing abundance of the TiO molecule in lower metallicity environments.

\section{Conclusions} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusions}

KMOS spectroscopy of red supergiant stars (RSGs) in NGC\,6822 is presented.
The data were telluric corrected in two different ways and the standard 3-arm telluric method is shown to work as effectively (in most cases) as the more time expensive 24-arm telluric method.

Stellar parameters are calculated for 11 RSGs using the $J$-band analysis method outlined in
\cite{2010MNRAS.407.1203D}.
The average metallicity within NGC\,6822 is
$\bar{Z} = -0.52\pm 0.21$,
consistent with previous abundance studies of young stars.
We find an indication of a metallicity gradient within the central 1\,kpc,
however with a low significance caused by the small size and limited spatial extent of our RSG sample.
To conclusively assess the presence of a metallicity gradient among the young population within NGC\,6822 a larger systematic study of RSGs is needed.

Using a closed-box chemical evolution model,
measurements of the young and old stellar populations of NGC\,6822 can be explained through chemical evolution. 
However, while an interesting result, we note that the closed-box model is unlikely to be a good assumption for this galaxy given its morphology.

The effective temperatures of RSGs in this study are compared to those of all RSGs analysed using the same method.
Using results which span 0.7 dex in metallicity (solar-like to SMC-like) within four galaxies, we find no evidence for a systematic variation in average effective temperature with respect to metallicity.
This is in contrast with evolutionary models for which a change in metallicity of 0.7 dex produces a shift in the temperature of RSGs of up to 450K.
We argue that an observed shift in average spectral type of RSGs observed over the same metallicity range (0.7 dex) does not imply a shift in average temperature.

These observations were taken as part of the KMOS Science Verification program.
With guaranteed time observations we have obtained data for RSGs in NGC\,300 and NGC\,55 at distances of $\sim$1.9\,Mpc,
as well as observations of super-star clusters in M\,83 and the Antennae galaxy at 4.5 and 20\,Mpc respectively.
Owing to the fact that RSGs dominate the light output from super-star clusters
\citep{2013MNRAS.430L..35G} these clusters can be analysed for abundance estimates in a similar manner
\citep{2014ApJ...787..142G},
which will provide metallicity measurements at distances a factor of 10 larger than using individual RSGs!
This work will form the basis of an ambitious general observation proposal to survey a large number of galaxies in the Local Volume,
motivated by the twin goals of investigating their abundance patterns,
while also calibrating the relationship between galaxy mass and metallicity in the Local Group.

%% facilities. A common set of keywords will make these types of searches
%% significantly easier and more accurate. In addition, they will also be
%% useful in linking papers together which utilize the same telescopes
%% within the framework of the National Virtual Observatory.
%% See the AASTeX Web site at http://aastex.aas.org/
%% for information on obtaining the facility keywords.

%% After the acknowledgments section, use the following syntax and the
%% \facility{} macro to list the keywords of facilities used in the research
%% for the paper.  Each keyword will be checked against the master list during
%% copy editing.  Individual instruments or configurations can be provided
%% in parentheses, after the keyword, but they will not be verified.

{\it Facilities:},
\facility{VLT (KMOS)}.

%% Appendix material should be preceded with a single \appendix command.
%% There should be a \section command for each appendix. Mark appendix
%% subsections with the same markup you use in the main body of the paper.

%% Each Appendix (indicated with \section) will be lettered A, B, C, etc.
%% The equation counter will reset when it encounters the \appendix
%% command and will number appendix equations (A1), (A2), etc.

%% The reference list follows the main body and any appendices.
%% Use LaTeX's thebibliography environment to mark up your reference list.
%% Note \begin{thebibliography} is followed by an empty set of
%% curly braces.  If you forget this, LaTeX will generate the error
%% "Perhaps a missing \item?".
%%
%% thebibliography produces citations in the text using \bibitem-\cite
%% cross-referencing. Each reference is preceded by a
%% \bibitem command that defines in curly braces the KEY that corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \cite commands (see the first section above).
%% Make sure that you provide a unique KEY for every \bibitem or else the
%% paper will not LaTeX. The square brackets should contain
%% the citation text that LaTeX will insert in
%% place of the \cite commands.

%% We have used macros to produce journal name abbreviations.
%% AASTeX provides a number of these for the more frequently-cited journals.
%% See the Author Guide for a list of them.

%% Note that the style of the \bibitem labels (in []) is slightly
%% different from previous examples.  The natbib system solves a host
%% of citation expression problems, but it is necessary to clearly
%% delimit the year from the author name used in the citation.
%% See the natbib documentation for more details and options.
